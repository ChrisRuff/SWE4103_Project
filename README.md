Presented to you by TEAM 2!

Currently front end is hooked up with circleci and will build, and run the tests every time master is pushed to. 

To find out how to build and run the front end see [this link](./frontend)
If you have any questions running the frontend please ask for help from someone on the team! 

# Happy developing! #
