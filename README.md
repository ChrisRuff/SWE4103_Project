# SWE4103_Project

Presented to you by TEAM 2!

Frontend is hooked up with circleci and will build, and run the tests every time master is pushed to. 
Backend is now working as well! Although no CI is working for it right now.

## Running the project ##
### Linux ###
* Install dotnet as well as aspnet-runtime. 
* Run these commands:
>`export ASPNETCORE_Environment=Development && dotnet build`

>`cd frontend && npm ci && cd ..`

>`dotnet run`

You can now connect to the development server by typing localhost:5000 into your web browser

## Windows ##
I'm not sure yet ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

To find out how to build and run the front end see [this link](./frontend)
If you have any questions running the frontend please ask for help from someone on the team! 

# Happy developing! #
